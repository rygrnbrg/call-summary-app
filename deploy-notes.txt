1. Make sure android.json file has entry:
    {
        "xml": "<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.SEND_SMS\" />",
        "count": 1
    }

2. Update version
    - config.xml   
    - package.json

3. Notice build-extras was added (scripts folder + config.xml)
    If not working, remove from xml and try again

4. Update google-services.json files with:
    "package_name": "real.estate.nadlanit"
    (in the first client info section)
